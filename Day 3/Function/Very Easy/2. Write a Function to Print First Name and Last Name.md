The input read by the program is stored as a string data type. A string is a collection of characters.

## Solution in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

// Function to print the full name
void print_full_name(string first, string last) {
    cout << "Hello " << first << " " << last << "! You just delved into function." << endl;
}

int main() {
    string firstName, lastName;
    
    // Read input
    getline(cin, firstName);
    getline(cin, lastName);
    
    // Call the function to print the full name
    print_full_name(firstName, lastName);
    
    return 0;
}
```
