# 4. Calculate the Area of a Rectangle Using Function

## Problem Description

Imagine you are developing a real-estate management app that calculates the floor area of different rooms. A user provides the length and width of a rectangle-shaped room, and your app needs to calculate its area. This function can also be applied in construction projects, interior designing, or other applications where accurate space measurement is essential. Your task is to write a reusable function for this calculation.

### Description
Given the length and width of a rectangle, write a function to calculate its area. The area of a rectangle is defined as:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

### Example 1
- **Input:** `length = 5`, `width = 10`
- **Output:** `50`
- **Explanation:** The area is calculated as \(5 \times 10 = 50\).

### Example 2
- **Input:** `length = 7`, `width = 3`
- **Output:** `21`
- **Explanation:** The area is calculated as \(7 \times 3 = 21\).

## Solution in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Function to calculate the area of a rectangle
float calculate_rectangle_area(float length, float width) {
    return length * width;
}

int main() {
    float length, width;
    
    // Example input
    std::cout << "Enter the length of the rectangle: ";
    std::cin >> length;
    std::cout << "Enter the width of the rectangle: ";
    std::cin >> width;

    // Calculate the area
    float area = calculate_rectangle_area(length, width);
    
    // Output the result
    std::cout << "The area of the rectangle is: " << area << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
