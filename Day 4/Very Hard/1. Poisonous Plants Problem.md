# 1. Poisonous Plants Problem

## Problem Description
You are given an array `p` representing the pesticide levels in a garden where each number corresponds to the pesticide level of a plant. 

- **Problem Statement:** After each day, any plant with a higher pesticide level than the plant to its left dies because it is weaker. Determine how many days it takes until no more plants die.

### Example
- **Input:** `p = [3, 6, 2, 7, 5]`
  - **Day 1:** Plants with indices 2 and 4 die since 6 > 3 and 7 > 2, leaving `p = [3, 2, 5]`.
  - **Day 2:** The plant at index 3 (5) dies since 5 > 2, leaving `p = [3, 2]`.
  - **Result:** No more plants die, so it takes 2 days.

- **Input:** `p = [6, 5, 8, 4, 7, 10, 9]`
  - **Day 1:** Plants at indices 3, 5, and 6 die, leaving `p = [6, 5, 4, 9]`.
  - **Day 2:** The plant at index 4 dies, leaving `p = [6, 5, 4]`.
  - **Result:** No more plants die, so it takes 2 days.

## Function Description
- **Function Name:** `poisonousPlants`
- **Parameter:** `int p[n]` - an array representing pesticide levels for each plant.
- **Return:** `int` - number of days until no more plants die due to pesticide.

## Input Format
- First line: An integer `n`, the number of plants.
- Second line: `n` space-separated integers representing the initial pesticide levels `p[i]`.

## Constraints
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`
- `1 ≤ p[i] ≤ 10^9`

## Algorithm Overview
- Use a stack or similar data structure to track plants that are still alive.
- Iterate through the days, simulating the death of plants based on the rule provided.

## Performance
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of plants, as each plant might need to be processed once for each day.
- Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the state of the plants.

## Solution

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

using namespace std;

int poisonousPlants(vector<int>& p) {
    int n = p.size();
    vector<int> days(n, 0);
    stack<int> st;
    
    st.push(0);
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        int day = 0;
        while (!st.empty() && p[st.top()] >= p[i]) {
            day = max(day, days[st.top()]);
            st.pop();
        }
        if (!st.empty()) {
            days[i] = day + 1;
        }
        st.push(i);
    }
    
    int result = 0;
    for (int day : days) {
        result = max(result, day);
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> p(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        cin >> p[i];
    }
    cout << poisonousPlants(p);
    return 0;
}
```
