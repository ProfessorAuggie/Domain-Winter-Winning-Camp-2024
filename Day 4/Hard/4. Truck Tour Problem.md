# [4. Truck Tour Problem](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/truck-tour/problem)

## Problem Description

Suppose there is a circle with `N` petrol pumps. Each petrol pump `i` has:
- An amount of petrol `P[i]`.
- A distance to the next petrol pump `D[i]`.

You have an infinite capacity tank starting with no petrol. You need to find the starting point from where a truck can complete the circle by stopping at each pump, assuming one liter of petrol moves the truck one kilometer.

### Input Format:
- The first line contains `N`, the number of petrol pumps.
- The next `N` lines contain two integers each - `P[i]` (petrol amount) and `D[i]` (distance to next pump).

### Constraints:
- `1 <= N <= 10^5`
- `1 <= P[i], D[i] <= 10^9`

### Output Format:
- An integer, which is the smallest index of the petrol pump from where the truck can start the tour.

### Example 1:
- **Sample Input:**
  3
  1 5
  10 3
  3 4
- **Sample Output:**
  1
- **Explanation:** 
- Starting from pump 0, we would run out of petrol before reaching pump 1 (1 petrol, 5 distance).
- Starting from pump 1, we have enough petrol (10) to cover the distance to pump 2 (3), and from there, we can go to pump 0 with the leftover and the new petrol (3 petrol, 4 distance), completing the circle.

## Solution in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

struct Pump {
  long long petrol;
  long long distance;
};

int truckTour(vector<Pump>& pumps) {
  int start = 0; 
  long long petrol_tank = 0; 
  long long deficit = 0; 

  for (int i = 0; i < pumps.size(); ++i) {
      petrol_tank += pumps[i].petrol - pumps[i].distance;
      
      if (petrol_tank < 0) {
          start = i + 1;
          deficit += petrol_tank; 
          petrol_tank = 0; 
      }
  }

  if (petrol_tank + deficit >= 0) {
      return start;
  } else {
      return -1; 
  }
}

int main() {
  int N;
  cin >> N;
  vector<Pump> pumps(N);

  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
      cin >> pumps[i].petrol >> pumps[i].distance;
  }

  cout << truckTour(pumps) << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
